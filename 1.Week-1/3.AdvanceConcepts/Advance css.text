◼We learn about some more concepts of advance css and html like responsive design , Flexbox , Grid layouts.

◼Responsive Web Design:-
What is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive web design (RWD) is a design approach aimed at creating web pages that provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices, 
from desktop computers to mobile phones. It ensures that web pages automatically adjust their layout, images, and text size according to the screen size and orientation 
of the device being used.

◻Key Principles of Responsive Web Design:-

Flexible Grid Layouts: Use percentage-based widths, relative units (em, %), and flexible grid layouts to ensure elements resize proportionally.
Flexible Images: Images should scale within their containing elements, using max-width properties to ensure they don’t overflow.
Media Queries: Media queries enable different styles to be applied based on device characteristics like width, height, or orientation.
Achieving Responsive Design using HTML and CSS

HTML Viewport Settings-
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page, and setting it properly helps in making web pages responsive.

Example of viewport meta tag:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

width=device-width sets the width of the viewport to match the width of the device’s screen.
initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.

Responsive Media Queries-
Media queries are a CSS feature used to apply styles depending on the device’s characteristics.

Basic Syntax:

        @media (max-width: 768px) {
        /* Styles applied to devices with a width of 768px or less */
        body {
            font-size: 14px;
        }
        .container {
            padding: 10px;
        }
        }

max-width specifies that the styles apply only when the viewport width is less than or equal to the specified value (in this example, 768px).
You can also use min-width for larger screens or combine multiple conditions.


◼Flexbox:-
What is Flexbox?
Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a one-dimensional layout model in CSS that allows you to easily align and distribute space among items in a container, 
even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic. It’s perfect for creating flexible, responsive layouts and provides more control over alignment, direction, 
order, and the size of elements.

◻Key Flexbox Concepts:

Flex Container and Flex Items-
The flex container is the parent element and is defined using display: flex;.
Flex items are the child elements of a flex container.

◻Key Flexbox Properties:

display: flex;: This property turns an element into a flex container.
flex-direction: Specifies the direction of the flex items (row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse).
justify-content: Defines the alignment of flex items along the main axis (e.g., center, space-between).
align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis (e.g., stretch, center).
flex-wrap: Allows flex items to wrap onto multiple lines.
flex: A shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.

◼CSS Grid :-
What is CSS Grid?
CSS Grid Layout, or simply "Grid," is a two-dimensional layout system in CSS. Unlike Flexbox, which is one-dimensional (row or column), 
the Grid layout allows you to design both rows and columns, making it ideal for creating complex, responsive web layouts with precision and flexibility.

◻Key Concepts of CSS Grid:-

Grid Container and Grid Items-
A grid container is an element with display: grid; or display: inline-grid;. It establishes a new grid formatting context for its children (known as grid items).
Grid items are the direct children of a grid container.

Grid Lines-
Grid lines divide the grid into cells. Horizontal grid lines define rows, and vertical grid lines define columns.

Common CSS Grid Properties-
display: grid;: Turns an element into a grid container.
grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows: Define the size and number of columns/rows in the grid.
gap: Adds spacing between grid items (use row-gap and column-gap for more specific control).
grid-column and grid-row: Control the placement and span of a grid item.
grid-template-areas: Defines named grid areas to position elements more intuitively.
justify-items, align-items: Control alignment within individual grid items.

◼Box-Sizing:-
In CSS, box-sizing controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated. Here’s a simple explanation of the two main types:-

◻1. content-box (Default Box Sizing)
What it means: When you set the width or height of an element, it only applies to the content area. Padding and borders are not included 
in that width/height value; instead, they are added on top.

Example: If you set an element’s width to 200px and then add 20px of padding and a 10px border, 
the total width becomes 200px (content) + 20px (left padding) + 20px (right padding) + 10px (left border) + 10px (right border) = 260px.

Use Case: This was the default behavior and can be useful when you want precise control over the content dimensions.

◻2. border-box
What it means: The width or height you set for an element includes padding and border. This makes it easier to 
size elements because you don’t need to calculate extra space for padding and borders.

Example: If you set an element’s width to 200px, and it has 20px padding and a 10px border, 
the content size will automatically shrink to make everything fit within 200px. The total width remains 200px.

Use Case: It’s simpler and often preferred for layouts since you don’t have to do as much math to figure out spacing.

◼Position:-
The position property in CSS is used to specify the positioning method of an element. Elements can be positioned using different values, 
which control how and where they appear on a webpage.

Values of position:-
static (default)
relative
absolute
fixed
sticky

Explanation of position values:-

position: static; (default):
Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow (no special positioning).
It does not respond to top, left, bottom, or right properties.

position: relative;:
The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
You can use top, left, bottom, and right properties to "nudge" the element relative to its normal position.

position: absolute;:
The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned (non-static) ancestor.
If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (viewport).
It is removed from the normal document flow.

position: fixed;:
The element is positioned relative to the viewport, meaning it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

position: sticky;:
The element toggles between relative and fixed positioning, depending on the scroll position.
It becomes fixed when you scroll past a specific threshold.
